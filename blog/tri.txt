Understanding the terms in your Olympic Triathlon Training Plan

You will find the workout descriptions of this Olympic-distance training plan self-explanatory for the most part, but the intensity and pacing guidelines require some explanation. Here’s a key to understanding them:
Low aerobic intensity	Your natural “easy” pace in swimming, cycling or running.
Moderate aerobic intensity 	An effort that is comfortable but not dawdling.
Threshold intensity 	An effort that is right on the threshold of making you really suffer.
Recovery intensity	A very comfortable effort, deliberately slower than your natural pace in swimming, cycling or running.
Hard	An effort that is very challenging but not maximal for the prescribed duration (such that a two-minute hard effort is performed at a slightly faster pace than a three-minute hard effort).
Sprint	A 100 percent maximal effort.
RI	Rest Interval – a duration of time for recovery between intervals in a workout.
WU	Warm-up
MS	Main set
CD	Cooldown
Your 16-Week Olympic Triathlon Training Plan
Week 1

The first 6 weeks of this Olympic triathlon training plan are known as the “base phase” of training. The primary objectives of this phase are to build your aerobic capacity and endurance and prepare your body to handle the high-intensity training to come in the build phase.
